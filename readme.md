[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3981)

---------

## Notice
This mod is no longer being supported.  You are strongly encouraged to use [Yet Another Spoiler Mod](https://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4166) instead...

## Introduction
This modification adds a BBCode to the forum that allows the post author to hide a changelog in the post, which is clickable to display it to the user.

This BBCode takes the forms:
    [nobbc]
    [nobbc][changelog]{content}[/changelog][/nobbc]
    [nobbc][changelog {params}]{content}[/changelog][/nobbc]
    [nobbc][changelog=Some Text]{content goes here}[/changelog][/nobbc]
    [/nobbc]

The **{params}** section may be any of the following parameters:

- **text** - Replaces default "changelog" text in the header.
- **quote** - Text that follows the "changelog" text in the header.  Must be in quotes.
- **show** - Replaces default "Show" text in the header.
- **hide** - Replaces default "Hide" text in the header.
- **guests** - Flag to show changelog to guests or not.  May be **n**, **no**, **false**, **y**, **yes**, or **true**.

Note that the form (#3) with the equal sign does not parse other block-level bbcode tags inside the changelog.  Empty form or form with parameters does not have this restriction.

## Admin Settings
This BBCode may be disabled by going into the **Admin** => **Forum** => **Posts and Topics** => **Bulletin Board Code** and unchecking the bbcodes you don't want to use.  You may also be uninstall this mod in order to disable it.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.9, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 1, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

## Changelog
The changelog can be viewed at [XPtsp.com](http://www.xptsp.com/board/free-modifications/expandable-changelog-bbcode/?tab=1).
